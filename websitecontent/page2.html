<h1>This bit is even trickier.</h1>
<div class="leftSide">
<p>As the previous page suggests, coming over to this page will alleviate all of the problems, concerns, and metaphysical speculations that have been troubling your life for some long period of time. Phew. Take a moment, enjoy your newfound peace and happiness, and let's continue down the rabbit hole on this, the day of my daughter's wedding. The only request I cannot grant is to cease the terrible jokes.</p>
<p>The trickier bit is that it is an even more treacherous road to speak of what I <em>will</em> do than it is to speak of what has already been done. I'm not prophet, and hubris is an ever-present temptation. I'll give it a go, though, to appease the gods of Galvanize.</p>

<h2>The Situation:</h2>

<p>Here we are at the foot of a big mountain. This mountain has a particular secret--no, it isn't called "Monkey", and is unlikely to end the world in flame--and that is this: at the top of the mountain is the door to an amazing career as a web developer. This is a door that I very, very, very much want to walk through. The nice thing is that the folks on the other side of the door seem to be welcoming and friendly--to those who manage to get there. Here's that tricky prophesy for you: I'm going to get there.</p>
<h2>How?</h2>

<h1>No More Locked Doors</h1>

<p>I considered using a fancy template to demonstrate my incredible copy & pasting skills and then telling you about why I'm a good fit for this or that aspect of programming, or that I've been a passionate hobbyist for some time, etc. etc. But actions are more potent than words--and we've got 24 weeks to see where the chips fall.</p>
